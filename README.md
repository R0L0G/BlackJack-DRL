# BlackJack-DRL

This is my BlackJack Deep Reinforcement Learning model, which I created as a project for a lecture. Markov Chain 
I created a new blackjack environment because I was attempting to design a model-based RL model, which is not possible in most prepackaged environments that use unlimited decks of cards. 
This feature solely serves to calculate the probability of drawing a not losing a card during the game.
